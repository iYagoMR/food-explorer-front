Food Explorer is a simple, DoorDash-like application I developed for my portfolio, showcasing both front-end and back-end development skills. The app allows users to browse food options, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout, similar to popular food delivery services.

**How to Run the Project Locally:**
To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repositories:**

- [Frontend (demo-version branch)](https://github.com/iYagoMR/food-explorer-front/tree/demo-version)
- [Backend (demo-version branch)](https://github.com/iYagoMR/food-explorer-api/tree/demo-version)

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the root directory of each project in your terminal and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

- `npm install`

3. **Run the Projects:** After the dependencies are installed, you can run both projects locally by executing the following command in each respective terminal:

- `npm run dev`

- Frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173/ (or whichever URL your terminal provides).
- Backend will be accessible as per the configuration in the backend repository.
  
**Key Features:**

- User Interface: Built with ReactJS, providing an interactive and responsive user experience.
- Backend: Powered by a Node.js backend (SQLite database), with API routes handling user authentication, orders, and dish management.
- Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout for smooth operation on both desktop and mobile devices.
